Welcome to my Udemy Courses Data Analytics project!

This project aims to analyze the Udemy courses dataset and provide insights on various aspects of the courses. The dataset we are using contains information on over 3,500 Udemy courses, including details on the course title, subject, level, content duration, number of lectures, price, and ratings.

The project will begin with data cleaning and preparation, including handling missing values and data formatting. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) will then be performed to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and identify any trends or patterns. Lastly, we will use data visualization in order to effectively communicate the findings.

The project will help people offering courses on Udemy in concluding with a summary of the findings and recommendations on how to improve their course offerings.
